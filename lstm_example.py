# This code first loads the economic data and stock market index data, combines them into a single dataset, and creates time series data for each variable by taking the difference between consecutive observations. It then splits the data into training and testing sets, scales the data to have zero mean and unit variance, and creates an LSTM model with 100 units. The model is trained on the training data and then used to make predictions on the test data. Finally, the model is evaluated using a metric such as mean squared error.

# This is just one example of how you might use an LSTM network to make predictions on stock market indexes based on economic data. There are many other factors to consider when building a predictive model, such as the choice of input features, the length of the input sequence, and the model architecture.
